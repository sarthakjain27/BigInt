# BigInt

This repository defines my implementation of a BigInteger Class in C++. We can initialize the BigInteger class either by passing number as a vector of single digit integers, a vector of character representing single digit integers and a c-array characters of single digit integers. 

Presently I have overloaded the binary + and - operator so that the BigInteger operations with these operators gets performed as normal integers would do. 

Upcoming operators to overload are as follows:

1) '*'

2) !

3) ==

4) '>='

5) '>'

6) <=

7) <

8) ++ (pre/post)

9) -- (pre/post)

10) <<

11) '>>'
