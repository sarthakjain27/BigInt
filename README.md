# BigInt

This repository defines my implementation of a BigInteger Class in C++. We can initialize the BigInteger class either by passing number as a vector of single digit integers, a vector of character representing single digit integers and a c-array characters of single digit integers. 

Implementation of BigInt class lets us break free from the 32/64 bit constraints of an integer and thus can now perform calculations with integer way way more than the maximum integer value allowed.

The following operators has been overloaded you can see the definition in .h file and their implementation in .cc file

1) '*'

2) !

3) ==

4) '>='

5) '>'

6) <=

7) <

8) ++ (pre/post)

9) -- (pre/post)

10) <<

11) '>>'

12) '+'

13) '-'
