# BigInt

This repository defines my implementation of a BigInteger Class in C++. We can initialize the BigInteger class either by passing number as a vector of single digit integers, a vector of character representing single digit integers and a c-array characters of single digit integers. 

Presently I have overloaded the binary + and - operator so that the BigInteger operations with these operators gets performed as normal integers would do. 

Upcoming operators to overload are as follows:

*

!

==

>=

>

<=

<

++ (pre/post)

-- (pre/post)

<<

>>
